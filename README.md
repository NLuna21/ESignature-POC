### myPdfViewer
Components:
- selectedFile: PDF file to render

üñºÔ∏è PDF Rendering
- Uses react-pdf's '<Document />' and '<Page />' to render the first page
- Disables text and annotation layers for cleaner visuals
- Captures page dimensions via onRenderSuccess for accurate field placement

üñ±Ô∏è Drag-and-Drop Behavior
- Uses react-dnd's useDrop to accept SIGNATURE_SLOT items
- Calculates drop position using monitor.getSourceClientOffset() and container bounds
- Adjusts y position slightly to align field visually
- Prevents multiple drops using hasDroppedSignature

üñäÔ∏è Signature Field Rendering
- Unsigned fields: Rendered as SignaturePlaceholder, draggable and clickable
